# Map Hostnames
#
# Magpie internally assumes that the nodenames provided by the
# scheduler/resource manager are the addresses that should be used for
# configuration AND they are identical to the output of the `hostname`
# command, which is used by Magpie to determine what nodes individual
# services should run on.
#
# If this is not true in your environment, you can provide commands
# below that will properly map hostnames/addresses/interfaces to the
# correct ones to use.  The commands you provide below should take a
# single argument as input, and return a single line of output with
# the host that should be used.
#
# The MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD_MAP command will be given the hostname as
# returned from the `hostname` command.  For example, if the scheduler
# uses the nodename "foobar", but the hostname command returns
# "foobar.foo.com", the script can simply return the output of
# `hostname -s` (which would be "foobar" in this example).
#
# The MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_SCHEDULER_MAP command will be given the hostname
# returned from the scheduler.  For example, if your job has been
# given the nodes "foobar[0-4]", but you want to use the IPs attached
# to "foobar-ib[0-4]", your script can simply return the appropriate
# "foobar-ib" interface for each nodename passed in.
#
# The user is not required to set both of these commands, but the end
# result is that Magpie requires the output of:
#
# - the `hostname` command or MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD_MAP
# and
# - the scheduler nodes or MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_SCHEDULER_MAP
#
# to map to the same hostnames/addresses
#
# export MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD_MAP="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/hostname-map-scripts/my-script"
#
# export MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_SCHEDULER_MAP="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/hostname-map-scripts/my-script"
